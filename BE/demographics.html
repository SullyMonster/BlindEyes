				<h2>Who Does It Help?</h2>
				<!--<br>-->
				<p>The Blind Eyes were thought up with blind students in mind. The reason we ended up choosing blind students was because we beleive that they have a hard time learning. The reason we thought this is because they have to learn braille along with the
					normal curriculum. They have to read everything in braille and have to have assistance to read if there is no braille to read.</p>

				<h2>Why Blind Students?</h2>
				<!--<br>-->
				<p>There are approximately 63,657 Blind people in learning environments based on research done by the American Foundation for the Blind. A lot of them may have learned braille, but there are still those who have not. We want to help those students read
					and know their surroundings with less reliance on their hands to see. If they could rely less on their hnds and more with the programming in the Blind Eyes, then they can simplify their lives and live easier. Granted it is no cure for the blind,
					but it is still ment to help and can be used to do so.
