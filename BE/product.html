				<p>The Blind Eyes are inspired by technology that helps the blind in similar ways, by helping the blind read text or describe images. Blind Eyes are able to read text and describe images like products before it, but it is also able to send the information
					to a wireless auditory device to turn the descriptions into text-to-speech and comes with facial recognition. We decided to put a microphone into the glasses attachment to give the device hands free use. Along with that, the AI created with TensorFlow
					could help us with responses through the auditory device in the ear.</p>

				<p>We want the Blind Eyes to be made of cheap, light weight material so that it can be affordable to people who live with less income. We believe that this innovation can be used in educational environments. The device is not entirely limited to the
					blind, because it can be used by anybody who can still hear. It can be used to make other peoples' lives easier if it were to be modified and became more user friendly. The idea of this innovation was based on programs that have already existed like
					the Seeing AI by Microsoft, an AI that is able to read and scan barcodes along with the ability to scan simple objects and describe them.</p>

				<p>The use of the artificial intelligence in the Blind Eyes is to find a way to use it to help people who need it. The Blind Eyes have a learning AI inside it that is taught to do things that specifically help the blind. Things that include describing
					images, objects, reading text, facial recognition, and understanding verbal prompts and commands.</p>
