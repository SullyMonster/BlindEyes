				<h2>Positive Impact</h2>
				<!--<br>-->
				<p>Blind Eyes will be able to help blind students by providing a relatively low cost device to aid them in reading and not having so much reliance on braille. We could make the daily life of the average blind person far easier by making this device.
					It if helpful in helping them fit in with their peers by allowing them to find people to talk and with TensorFlow's facial recognition, they can keep track of them.</p>

				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<!--<br>-->
				<p>The problem that be most common with Blind Eyes might be the problem with material and programming a functional AI to do all of what we though of. We want it to have facial recognition, the ability to view objects and to describe them, but it is a
					long shot. That kind of programming would cost a lot of money, which is the opposite of what we want the Blind Eyes to be. The materials quality would have to be poor and weak due to the cost limitations or because we want to keep it more afforadable.</p>
